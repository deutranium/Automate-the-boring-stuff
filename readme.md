# Automate The Boring Stuff

The only reason for the existence of this repo is to save some (if not much) time, and brainpower of lazy species like humans, by automating teeny-weeny but boring tasks which I happen to come across while coding some random stuff.

P.S. To save some brainpower, I haven't thought much about the UI of any of these (yet). Feel free to improve them.

P.S. again : Its always a work in progress
