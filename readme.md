# Automate The Boring Stuff

[//]: # "The only reason for the existence of this repo is to save some (if not much) time, and brainpower of lazy species like humans, by automating teeny-weeny but boring tasks which I happen to come across while doing some (not so) random stuff.P.S. To save some brainpower, I haven't thought much about the UI of any of these (yet). Feel free to improve them.P.S. again : It's always a work in progress"
